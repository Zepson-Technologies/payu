## Available Gateways

### PayU Money

With PayU, you can accept online payments from across all channels and devices, through a single processing platform. You can collect payments on any website, mobile app, tablet or using any social app. While there are many channels of payment acceptance, all your transactions reconcile in one easy-to-use location - the PayU payment gateway.
